ight Week Blog: Dalton Smith vs. Mathieu Germain
Hello fight fans and welcome to Sheffield for a high-stakes clash in which Dalton Smith puts his WBC Silver super lightweight title on the line against Canadian challenger Mathieu Germain. The bout, scheduled for April 19 at the Canon Medical Arena, is more than one line on the boxing calendar — it is a pivotal moment in the careers of the two fighters, with world title implications in the stakes.
Fight Week Vibe: Sheffield Star Returns Home
The sound of Dalton Smith (17-0, 13 KOs) is back home with his first fight in front of his people in Sheffield. Smith, 28, is undefeated and climbing the world rankings quickly. Smith’s momentum is undeniable after a lopsided January first-round stoppage win over Walid Ouizza for the European title. This Saturday he seeks to chalk up yet another opponent, and come one step closer to a world title shot.
That energy was tangible when Smith and Germain faced off this week, standing in front of Sheffield City Hall, both men oozing quiet confidence. For Smith, it is a chance to shine on home soil; for Germain, an opportunity to define his career.
THE CHALLENGER Mathieu Germain’s world tour
Mathieu Germain (26-2-1, 11 KOs), 35, is an acquitted brawler. The Canadian, who is on an eight-fight win streak, will make his international debut in Sheffield. Buried in technical skill and ruggedness, Germain last outmatched Carlos Daniel Aquino over seven in a statement win that earned him this eliminator shot.
At 6′1″, Germain holds a substantial height advantage at 5′9½” over Smith. Even though Germain's lost twice in total, each of those opponents has a record for being legitimate competition. He’s desperate to prove he can mix it on the world stage and fancies throwing a spanner in the works on enemy turf.
What’s at Stake?
This isn’t just about belts. The winner will place themselves among the leading candidates for the WBC world title at 140 lbs. The perfect blend of speed, power and technicality have seen plenty label Smith as Britain’s next world champion in the weight class. But Germain is in search of recognition and an opportunity at the sport’s crowning honor.
Undercard Highlights
The undercard is stuffed with talent:
Josh Warrington was back in the super featherweight mix after a nasty scrape with Asad Asif Khan.
Ryan Kelly meets Caoimhin Agyarko for the WBA Continental super welterweight belt.
Josh Padley and Marko Cvetanovic clash for WBA International strap at lightweight
In an all-English super featherweight clash, rising stars Giorgio Visioli and Kane Baker square off.
Prediction and Final Thoughts
The bookmakers show Smith as a strong favorite, and they have good reason to. He’s younger, fighting at home, and has a higher knockout ratio. But Germain’s experience and his height might pose problems for Smith if he doesn’t take him seriously. Smith is likely to start quick, try to set his power and create a highlight reel finish. Germain’s persistence, though, makes him hard to dismiss.
“Smith is the bigger man and he’s got Germain on every single category — chin, power. Smith should also be approaching his prime at this point, and should be in his agrressive-hitting-and-landing-with-authority prime. With Smith in action at home as well, I don’t see us having any problems doing enough to secure victory, and a finish here is a good shout.” 3
The fight night will be filled with drama and skill and the kind of atmosphere only Sheffield can deliver. Whether you’re rooting for the hometown hero or the underdog, this is one not to miss.
